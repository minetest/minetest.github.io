## Loading server list

### Information collected

When you open the Play Online tab, Minetest will request the server list.
The following information will be transferred or included:

* IP address
* Minetest version
* Platform and Operating System

### How it is used

HTTP requests are logged to aid with debugging, development and user
support. They may also be used to generate anonymized, aggregated user statistics.

### Who has access

sfan5 runs the server list and has access to the logs. Logs may be shared with
others to aid with debugging, user support, or combating abuse.

### Period of retention

Logged HTTP requests are stored for up to 3 months.

### Location

The server list is currently located in the Netherlands.


## ContentDB

You can find more information on
[ContentDB's privacy policy](https://content.minetest.net/privacy_policy/).

### Information collected

Requests to [ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net) will be made in the main
menu when using the ContentDB feature. This includes checking for updates then
you have packages from ContentDB installed. The following information will be
transferred or included:

* IP address
* Page URL
* Minetest version
* Platform and Operating System

### How it is used

HTTP requests are logged to aid with debugging, development, and aggregated
statistics.

Requests (such as downloads) are used for aggregated statistics and for
calculating the popularity of packages. Download counts are shown for each
package and release, and there are also download graphs available for each
package.

Whether an IP address has downloaded a package or release is cached to prevent
downloads from being counted multiple times per IP address, but this information
is deleted regularly.

### Who has access

rubenwardy runs ContentDB and has access to the logs. Logs may be shared with
others to aid with debugging, user support, or combating abuse.

### Period of retention

Logged HTTP requests are automatically deleted within 2 weeks.

### Location

ContentDB is currently located in Germany and backups are stored within the
United Kingdom and/or EU. By using this service, you give permission for the
data to be moved within the United Kingdom and/or EU.

### Removal requests

See [ContentDB's privacy policy](https://content.minetest.net/privacy_policy/#removal-requests).

### Information collected

When you open Minetest, it may contact www.minetest.net to fetch information
about the most recent version. The following information will be transferred or
included:

### How it is used
